abstract: >
  SMRK-GUEGAP Probe is a deterministic numerical framework designed to test
  whether arithmetic SMRK-style operator families can simultaneously exhibit
  GUE-like bulk spectral statistics and stable low-energy spectral gaps.
  The system emphasizes reproducibility, canonical JSON hashing, and
  audit-friendly dense diagonalization protocols.
