Reference distributions placeholder.
SMRK-GUEGAP Probe — Reference Distributions (v1)

This directory contains frozen reference distributions for spacing-ratio
statistics used in v1 of the protocol.

The distributions are defined on fixed bins in [0,1] with B=50.

Files:
- r_ref_gue_v1.json
- r_ref_goe_v1.json
- r_ref_poisson_v1.json

These files are deterministic and versioned.
Their SHA256 hashes are recorded in build metadata.

Future protocol versions may replace these with large Monte Carlo
ensembles, but v1 uses fixed frozen artifacts.
